2048 Tile Game Made with Android Studio

Hello class. So this is a standard 2048 game that is fully functioning. To spice up the gameplay, I have included:
1) Standard Mode: Your typical normal 2048 game 
2) Easy Mode: Tired of losing? Well with this mode you get to already start with high values including 1048... Can't lose now right...?
3) Hard Mode: In this mode, Random selected 5 tiles begin with a negative value. When common negative values add up, they become even greater negative values... Can you win it?

Further Ideas:
Because I am a big meme fan, I would definitely love to incorporate some sort of memes. For further improvements, I'd definitely implement perhaps like meme tiles, or collectable memes unlocked depending on the high scores.

Thanks for checking out my version of 2048.
